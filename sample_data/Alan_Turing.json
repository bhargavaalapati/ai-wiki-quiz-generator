  "title": "Alan Turing",
  "summary": "Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician and computer scientist, highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science through his concept of the Turing machine. During World War II, he played a crucial role at Bletchley Park in breaking German ciphers, significantly aiding the Allied war effort. After the war, he was prosecuted for homosexuality and died in 1954, only receiving a posthumous royal pardon in 2013.",
